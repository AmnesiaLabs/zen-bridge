- Open source and ridiculously simple Node-based API, based upon the pioneering [code of its predecessor](https://github.com/wtfaremyinitials/osa-imessage).
- Automatically shares new messages with Zen peers (eg. [Zen Client](https://github.com/AmnesiaLabs/zen-client)), and even other Bridges ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- Runs on outdated macOS hardware (OS X/macOS 10.10 and up, wipe dust off your old Mac mini)!
- Supports raw file transfers.
- A GUI wrapper for Zen Bridge [is in the works](https://github.com/AmnesiaLabs/zen-bridge-ui)!
